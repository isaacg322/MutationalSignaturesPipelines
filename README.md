# MutationalSignaturesPipelines
Scripts used to annotate mutational signatures from mutation matrices

hdp - based on hierarchichal dritchlet processes insteas of non-negative matrix factorization. Allows for sample clusterization of mutational signature signals (i.e. single or double chain).
sigProfilerExtractor - quite standard in the field, much less hands on than hdp, but also a bit innacurate. Does not allow sample clusterization when annotating de novo mutational signatures.
